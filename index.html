    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>The night was Halloween of 1984 in Hawkins, Indiana.</p>
    <p>A boy was walking alone down a long and winding path.</p>
    <p>Suddenly a lady appears on a motorcycle!</p>
    <p>She is large, thick, and beautiful.</p>
    <p>There is slime oozing from its fins and blood covering its tentacles.</p>
    <p>But enough about the bicycle, you might be saying. Does the creature look friendly?</p>
